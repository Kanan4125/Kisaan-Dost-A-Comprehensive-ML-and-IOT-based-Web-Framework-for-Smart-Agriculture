# Kisaan-Dost-A-Comprehensive-ML-and-IOT-based-Web-Framework-for-Smart-Agriculture

ABSTRACT:
Agriculture is considered to be one of the major sectors in the Indian economy as it con-
tributes 20.19 percent in Indiaâ€™s total GDP, and approximately more than 60 percent of
the Indian population is engaged in agriculture and other allied activities like animal hus-
bandry for their living. The idea is to develop IOT integrated system (BHU PARIKSHAK) to
overcome problem of under productivity, overfertilization and soil quality degradation. BHU
PARIKSHAK is enabled with various environmental and soil quality parameter sensing mod-
ules which are utilized to sense and extract on-field data instances. System is inter-connected
with fog computing server to store and compute data instances.Data instance from server
is passed as an Input parameter to ML model being deployed over Flask and BI tool from
where Feature evaluation and Data visualization task is undertaken. Server is also integrated
with Kisaan Dost web-app to access the visuals of knowledge report insights.
